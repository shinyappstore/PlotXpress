# plotXpress: Streamlined Data Processing for Dual Luciferase Expression Assays

#### Use app online: __[www.shinyappstore.com/a/plotXpress](https://shinyappstore.com/a/plotXpress)__

PlotXpress app is tailored for processing and visualizing data from dual luciferase expression assays, which involve measuring both firefly and Renilla luciferase activities in a sequential manner. The results are presented as the firefly-to-Renilla luciferase activity ratio. This app is compatible with data from the Promega GloMax reader and utilizes Renilla signal for data normalization. It generates relative expression plots, grouping data by conditions and various treatments. PlotXpress simplifies the analysis and visualization of dual luciferase experiments in a 96-well format, primarily focusing on gene expression assays of this type. Users can upload data in either the xlsx format generated by a GloMax reader along with a file listing experimental conditions per well, or as a single CSV file in tidy format. The application offers normalization based on an internal control and allows the calculation of fold changes for conditions relative to a selected reference condition.
